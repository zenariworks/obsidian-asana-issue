# Kanban plugin compatibility

The Asana Issue plugin can be integrated with the [obsidian-kanban plugin](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-kanban) in order to create nice Kanban board that allows you to track the progress of your task.

It is recommended to use inside the Kanban cards the [inline issue](/docs/components/inline-issue) syntax in compact mode. This approach will reduce the amount of information in each card.

Example:
```
JIRA:-TEZ-4431
- [x] QA validation
- [ ] Load to production
- [ ] Client Validation
```
