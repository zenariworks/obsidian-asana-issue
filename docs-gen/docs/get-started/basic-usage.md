# Basic usage

The plugin provides several components to display Asana issues in your notes.
You can find details about each component in the dedicated section [Components](/docs/category/components).

The simplest way to insert a reference to a Asana issue is to use the [inline syntax](/docs/components/inline-issue).
Open a note and use the prefix `JIRA:` followed by the issue key to add a reference to the issue.
```
This is an example of note with a reference to the issue JIRA:AMQCPP-711
```
